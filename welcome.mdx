        <Accordion title="What is Bot Studio?" icon="circle-question">
          Bot Studio is your complete solution for creating customer-facing AI chatbots. Unlike hybrid chatbot solutions where a human team sits behind the scenes, Bot Studio chatbots are 100% AI-driven — perfect for businesses looking to completely automate customer interactions without hiring support staff.

          Your chatbots integrate seamlessly into websites using a single line of JavaScript, and any changes you make in the admin panel instantly reflect on the live chatbot.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title="Key Features" icon="stars">

          - **Agentic Workflows**: Configure backend automations when leads come in (push to CRM, alert teams, trigger workflows)
          - **Hierarchical RAG**: Two-step retrieval for businesses with multiple products, properties, or branches — filters by category first, then dives deeper

          AI Studio provides no-code tools for internal team productivity. It consists of two main components:

          **AI Tools** — Simple forms backed by AI prompts that generate outputs (non-conversational). Think of them as AI-powered utilities for specific tasks.

          **AI Assistants** — Conversational AI that your teams can chat with, similar to ChatGPT but customized for your business and grounded in your company knowledge.

          Both can be attached to Sources (your documents and knowledge bases) to ensure responses are accurate and relevant.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title="AI Tools in Detail" icon="wrench">

      <AccordionGroup>
        <Accordion title="What is API Console?" icon="circle-question">
          API Console is the developer-focused mode for integrating AI directly into your products. It's built on our v1 infrastructure that powers everything:

          **Prompts API** — Non-conversational AI for one-off generations (the backend for AI Tools)

          **Personas API** — Conversational AI with state and memory management (the backend for AI Assistants and Chatbots)

          Both APIs provide robust prompt management, versioning, hyperparameter control, and multi-model support.
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title="Prompts API" icon="terminal">
          The Prompts API is designed for non-conversational, form-based AI workflows:

          **Key Features**
          - Store and version prompt configurations centrally
          - Set default versions and switch between them
          - Support multiple model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
          - Manage hyperparameters (temperature, top-p, etc.)
          - Attach to Sources for grounded responses
          - Full audit logging and prompt lifecycle management

          **Versioning**
          - Create 10 different versions with 10 different prompts
          - Each version can use different models or configurations
          - Your application code stays the same — just reference version numbers
          - Easy A/B testing and rollback capabilities

          **Use Cases**
          - Generate dynamic content in your SaaS application
          - Process user inputs and return structured outputs
          - Build AI features without managing infrastructure
          - Centralize prompt management across your product
        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title="Personas API" icon="message">
          The Personas API provides conversational AI with built-in intelligence:

          - Versioned persona configurations
          - Multi-model provider support

        </Accordion>

        <Accordion title="Why Use API Console vs Higher-Level Tools?" icon="diagram-project">
          **AI Tools & Assistants** provide no-code abstractions — great for business users but limited customization for developers.

          **API Console** gives you:
          - Full control over the user experience in your product
          - Ability to embed AI anywhere in your application
          - Versioning and prompt management out of the box
          - Multi-model flexibility without code changes
          - Custom integration with your existing workflows

    The Foundation: Sources
  </h2>
  <p className="text-[#4b5563] dark:text-[#9ca3af] text-center max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-8">
    All three modes are powered by Sources — your business documents, web pages, and text snippets. Upload once, attach to any chatbot, tool, assistant, prompt, or persona.
  </p>

  <AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="What are Sources?" icon="brain">
      Sources are collections of your business knowledge. Each Source can contain:
      - **Documents**: PDFs, Word files, text files, presentations
      - **Web Pages**: Scraped content from URLs you provide
      - **Text Snippets**: Manual text entries for specific information

      Once uploaded, content is processed and indexed by our Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) engine.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do Sources work?" icon="gears">
      **Upload Once, Use Everywhere**
      - Create a Source and upload your content
      - Attach the Source to any prompt, persona, tool, assistant, or chatbot
      - AI automatically retrieves relevant information during conversations or generations

      **Grounded Responses**
      - AI responses are based on your actual business information
      - Reduces hallucinations and incorrect answers
      - Provides accurate, contextually relevant responses

      **Important Note**: Sources are not live-synced. If you update a document externally, you'll need to re-upload it to the Source.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Hierarchical RAG for Complex Businesses" icon="sitemap">
      For businesses with multiple products, properties, or branches, standard RAG treats everything equally. Hyperleap AI offers Hierarchical RAG:

      **Two-Step Retrieval Process**
      1. **First Level**: AI determines which category/product/property the user is inquiring about
      2. **Second Level**: AI dives deeper into that specific category to find detailed information

      **Use Cases**
      - Real estate with multiple properties
      - Retail with multiple product lines
      - Hospitality with multiple locations
      - Organizations with multiple departments or divisions
