## Build AI Solutions for Your Business

Hyperleap AI provides a complete platform for businesses to develop AI solutions across three distinct modes, each designed for specific use cases:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Bot Studio" icon="comments" href="/guides/chatbots/chatbots">
    **Customer-Facing AI Chatbots**

    Deploy fully customizable, 24/7 AI chatbots on your website and social channels. Capture leads, answer questions, and automate customer interactions with zero code required.
  </Card>

  <Card title="AI Studio" icon="wrench" href="/guides/tools">
    **Internal Team Productivity**

    Empower your teams with AI Tools and AI Assistants that automate workflows from marketing to sales to operations. Choose from 500+ pre-built tools or create custom ones.
  </Card>

  <Card title="API Console" icon="code" href="/api-reference/introduction">
    **Product Integration**

    Integrate AI capabilities directly into your products using our REST APIs for Prompts and Personas. Build custom AI experiences with state management, versioning, and multi-model support.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

All three modes are built on a unified foundation that makes your AI grounded in truth and company knowledge.

### Sources: The Foundation

<Card title="Sources" icon="brain" href="/guides/sources">
  Upload your business documents, web pages, and text snippets to create **Sources**. Each Source becomes a knowledge base that can be attached to any chatbot, tool, assistant, prompt, or persona across all three modes.

  Our advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) engine ensures your AI delivers accurate, contextually relevant responses based on your actual business information.
