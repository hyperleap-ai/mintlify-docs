## Error Format

The error response body returned by API follows this format:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "error_code",
    "message": "A human-readable description of the error",
    "details": [
      {
        "field": "field_name",
        "issue": "Description of the issue with this field"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The `details` array is optional and only included for validation errors to indicate which fields had issues.
