Personas are AI personalities that you can configure and integrate into your applications. They provide consistent interaction styles and behaviors by maintaining specific personality traits, expertise levels, and communication patterns. With personas, you can ensure your AI interactions align with your brand voice and communication goals across all touchpoints.

## Working with Personas

Simple 4 step process to start using personas:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Design Your Experience">
    Design your product's conversational interface in our AI Console. Define conversation flows, personality traits, and response patterns. Add variables to control tone, inputs, expertise level, and behavior. Perfect for support agents, product guides, or interactive features in your products.

    </Card>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test in Playground">
    Test your persona across models and configurations, and finalize what works. Refine responses, adjust behaviors, and ensure perfect integration with your product before going live. Preview conversations exactly as users will experience them.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Integrate & Deploy">
    Add conversations to your product through simple REST API calls. Send user messages and context as JSON payloads while our infrastructure handles the complexities. Works with any programming language or framework you're already using.

    ```javascript
    const response = await fetch('https://api.hyperleapai.com/conversations/persona', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'x-hl-api-key': 'your_api_key_here',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        persona_id: 'your_persona_id',
        persona_version_id: 'your_persona_version_id',
        replacements: {
          variable_name: 'variable_value'
          ...
        }
      })
    });
    ```

    <Note>
      For detailed API specifications and more examples, check out our [Conversations API Reference](/api-ref/conversations/overview).
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor & Scale">
    Get consistent, on-brand conversations that adapt to user needs. Track metrics, monitor performance, and adjust behavior without code deploys. Scale automatically as your product grows.

  </Step>
