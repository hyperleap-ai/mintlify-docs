Personas are AI personalities that you can configure and integrate into your applications. They provide consistent interaction styles and behaviors by maintaining specific personality traits, expertise levels, and communication patterns. With personas, you can ensure your AI interactions align with your brand voice and communication goals across all touchpoints.

## Working with Personas

Simple 4 step process to start using personas:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Design Your Experience">
    Design your product's conversational interface in our API Console.
    - Define personality traits, expertise, and communication style or import pre-configured persona from persona library
    - Add sources to provide context
    - Select an AI model that fits your use case
    - Fine tune the persona configuration

    </Card>

  </Step>

<Step title="Test in Playground">
  Test your persona using various models and configurations to determine the
  optimal setup. Refine the responses and behaviors to ensure seamless
  integration with your application. Preview conversations as they will appear
  to users.
</Step>

  <Step title="Integrate & Deploy">
    Integrate conversations into your application using straightforward REST API calls. Send user messages and context as JSON payloads, allowing our infrastructure to manage the complexities. This approach is compatible with any programming language or framework.

    ```javascript
    // Example API integration using Javascript
    const response = await fetch('https://api.hyperleapai.com/conversations/persona', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'x-hl-api-key': 'your_api_key_here',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        persona_id: 'your_persona_id',
        persona_version_id: 'your_persona_version_id',
        replacements: {
          variable_name: 'variable_value'
          ...
        }
      })
    });
    ```

    <Note>
      For detailed API specifications and more examples, check out our [Conversations API Reference](/api-reference/conversations/overview).
    </Note>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor & Scale">
    Ensure consistent conversations that adapt to user needs. Monitor performance metrics and adjust configurations without code deployments. Audit logs for each interaction are accessible, allowing for effective tracking and scaling as your product grows.
