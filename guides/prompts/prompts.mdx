Prompts in Hyperleap AI are pre-configured instructions that guide AI responses for your specific use cases. They act as templates that can be reused across your organization, ensuring consistent and accurate AI interactions while reducing prompt engineering effort.

Simple 4 step process to start using prompts

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create and Configure">
    Design your AI feature in our API Console.
    - Define the prompt template, add dynamic variables or import pre-configured prompt from prompt library
    - Set your preferred AI model
    - Add Sources to provide context
    - Fine tune the prompt configuration

    </Card>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Save and Test">
    After configuration, your prompt will have a dedicated REST API endpoint. You can test each prompt in our playground prior to deployment.
    - After testing, you can publish the prompt to your teamspace for reuse by other users

  </Step>

  <Step title="Integrate via API">
    To integrate with the API, perform a REST API call from your application. Send your variables in a JSON format, and the system will handle the AI context and state management. This is compatible with any programming language or framework.

    ```javascript
    // Example API integration using JavaScript
    const response = await fetch('https://api.hyperleapai.com/prompt-runs/execute', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'x-hl-api-key': 'your_api_key_here',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        prompt_id: 'your_prompt_id',
        prompt_version_id: 'your_prompt_version_id',
        replacements: {
          variable_name: 'variable_value'
          ...
        }
      })
    });

    const result = await response.json();
    ```

    <Note>
      For detailed API specifications and more examples, check out our [Prompts API Reference](/api-reference/prompts/overview). You'll find complete documentation of all available endpoints, parameters, and response formats.
    </Note>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy and Monitor">
    Ensure your prompts deliver consistent responses as configured. You can monitor usage, track costs, and adjust settings without code changes. Access audit logs to review interactions and gather feedback for continuous improvement.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues you might encounter and how to resolve them:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Variable Substitution Errors">
    **Issue**: Prompt variables not being replaced with actual values.
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Verify variable names match exactly in both prompt template and input
    - Check for proper syntax: `{{variableName}}`
    - Ensure all required variables are provided in the request
    - Use the Studio interface to validate variable substitution
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Context Length Exceeded">
  **Issue**: Total prompt length including context exceeds model limits.
  **Solutions**: - Reduce context length by summarizing or chunking data - Use
  shorter prompt templates - Consider using our automatic context truncation
  feature - Monitor token count in Studio before deployment
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Response Format Mismatch">
    **Issue**: AI responses not matching expected format structure.
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Use format instructions in your prompt template
    - Implement response validation
    - Test prompts in Studio before production use
    - Consider using our structured output templates
