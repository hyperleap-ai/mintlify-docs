Prompts in Hyperleap are pre-configured instructions that guide AI responses for your specific use cases. They act as templates that can be reused across your organization, ensuring consistent and accurate AI interactions while reducing prompt engineering effort.

## How Prompts Work

Prompts in Hyperleap follow a structured approach:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Input Processing" icon="inbox-in">
    Your prompt template receives inputs from your configured fields. These inputs are validated and prepared for processing.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Variable Substitution" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Dynamic variables in your prompt are replaced with actual values, allowing for flexible and reusable prompt templates.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Context Integration" icon="database">
    Relevant context from your connected data sources is incorporated, enriching the prompt with necessary background information.
  </Card>

  <Card title="AI Processing" icon="microchip">
    The final prompt is processed by our AI engine to generate responses, leveraging advanced language models for optimal results.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Prerequisites

Before creating prompts, ensure you have:
- Access to [Studio](https://studio.hyperleapai.com)
- Credits in your account

## Working with Prompts

Simple 4 step process to start using prompts
<Steps>
  <Step title="Create and Configure">
    Design your AI feature in our intuitive interface. Either start from scratch or use our template library. Add dynamic variables to handle user inputs, set your preferred AI model, and configure response formats. Perfect for building features like content generation, data analysis, or custom AI workflows.

    </Card>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save and Activate">
    Once configured, your prompt automatically gets a dedicated REST API endpoint. Each prompt can be tested in our playground before going live.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Integrate via API">
    Make a simple REST API call from your application. Pass your variables as JSON payload and let our infrastructure handle the complexities of AI context management, token optimization, and state handling.

    ```javascript
    // Example API integration
    const response = await fetch('https://api.hyperleapai.com/prompt-runs/execute', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'x-hl-api-key': 'your_api_key_here',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        prompt_id: 'your_prompt_id',
        prompt_version_id: 'your_prompt_version_id',
        replacements: {
          variable_name: 'variable_value'
          ...
        }
      })
    });

    const result = await response.json();
    ```

    <Note>
      For detailed API specifications and more examples, check out our [Prompts API Reference](/api-ref/prompts/overview). You'll find complete documentation of all available endpoints, parameters, and response formats.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Ship with Confidence">
    Get consistent, production-ready responses formatted exactly as you configured. Monitor usage, track costs, and adjust prompt behavior without deploying code changes. Scale automatically as your usage grows.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting
Common issues you might encounter and how to resolve them:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Variable Substitution Errors" icon="brackets-curly">
    **Issue**: Prompt variables not being replaced with actual values.
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Verify variable names match exactly in both prompt template and input
    - Check for proper syntax: `{variableName}`
    - Ensure all required variables are provided in the request
    - Use the Studio interface to validate variable substitution
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Context Length Exceeded" icon="text-size">
    **Issue**: Total prompt length including context exceeds model limits.
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Reduce context length by summarizing or chunking data
    - Use shorter prompt templates
    - Consider using our automatic context truncation feature
    - Monitor token count in Studio before deployment
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Response Format Mismatch" icon="code-merge">
    **Issue**: AI responses not matching expected format structure.
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Use format instructions in your prompt template
    - Implement response validation
    - Test prompts in Studio before production use
    - Consider using our structured output templates
