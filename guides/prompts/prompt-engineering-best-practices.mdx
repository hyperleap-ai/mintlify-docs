## Core Techniques

### 1. Clear Instruction Writing

**Be Explicit About Your Expectations**

<CodeGroup>
```text Poor Example
Write about customer service.
```

```text Good Example
Write a 300-word professional email response to a customer complaint about delayed shipping. Include:
- Acknowledgment of the issue
- Explanation of the delay
- Specific resolution steps
- Timeline for resolution
- Compensation offer
```
</CodeGroup>

**Use Action-Oriented Language**

<CodeGroup>
```text Weak
You should think about...
```

```text Strong
Analyze the following data and identify...
```
</CodeGroup>

### 2. Context Setting and Framing

**Establish Clear Context**

```text
You are a senior financial analyst at a Fortune 500 company. Your task is to evaluate investment opportunities for Q4 2024. Consider the following market conditions:
- Rising interest rates
- Inflation concerns
- Technology sector volatility

Based on this context, analyze the following investment proposal...
```

**Use Role-Based Prompting**

```text
Act as an experienced software architect with 15 years in distributed systems. 
Review the following system design and provide feedback on:
1. Scalability concerns
2. Security vulnerabilities
3. Performance bottlenecks
4. Recommended improvements
```

### 3. Output Format Specification

**Structure Your Expected Output**

```text
Analyze the customer feedback and respond in the following format:

## Summary
[Brief overview in 2-3 sentences]

## Key Issues Identified
- Issue 1: [Description]
- Issue 2: [Description]
- Issue 3: [Description]

## Recommended Actions
1. [Action item with timeline]
2. [Action item with timeline]
3. [Action item with timeline]

## Risk Assessment
[Low/Medium/High] - [Explanation]
```

**Specify Data Types and Constraints**

```text
Extract the following information and format as JSON:
{
  "customer_name": "string",
  "order_id": "string (8 characters)",
  "issue_category": "string (one of: shipping, product, billing, other)",
  "priority": "number (1-5 scale)",
  "resolution_required": "boolean"
}
```

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Chain of Thought Prompting

Guide the AI through step-by-step reasoning:

```text
Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, identify all the given variables in the problem
2. Then, determine what we need to find
3. Next, choose the appropriate formula or method
4. Finally, calculate the result and verify it makes sense

Problem: [Your problem here]
```

### 2. Few-Shot Learning

Provide examples to establish patterns:

```text
I need you to categorize customer inquiries. Here are some examples:

Input: "My order hasn't arrived yet, when will it be delivered?"
Category: Shipping
Urgency: Medium

Input: "I was charged twice for the same item"
Category: Billing
Urgency: High

Input: "How do I return this product?"
Category: Returns
Urgency: Low

Now categorize this inquiry:
Input: "The product arrived damaged, I need a replacement"
Category: ?
Urgency: ?
```

### 3. Constraint-Based Prompting

Set clear boundaries and limitations:

```text
Create a product description with these constraints:
- Maximum 150 words
- Include exactly 3 key benefits
- Use active voice only
- Include one compelling statistic
- Target audience: small business owners
- Tone: professional but approachable
- Avoid technical jargon
```

### 4. XML Structuring for Complex Prompts

Use XML tags to create clear, parseable prompt structures with embedded variables:

```text
<task>
Analyze the customer support ticket and provide a structured response
</task>

<context>
<customer_info>
Name: {{customer_name}}
Tier: {{customer_tier}}
Account_since: {{account_date}}
</customer_info>

<ticket_details>
Category: {{issue_category}}
Priority: {{priority_level}}
Description: {{issue_description}}
</ticket_details>
</context>

<instructions>
<response_format>
<summary>Brief issue summary in 1-2 sentences</summary>
<analysis>Detailed problem analysis</analysis>
<solution>Step-by-step resolution plan</solution>
<timeline>Expected resolution timeframe</timeline>
</response_format>

<guidelines>
- Use empathetic language appropriate for {{customer_tier}} customers
- Include specific next steps with deadlines
- Reference relevant help articles when applicable
- If {{priority_level}} is "high", include escalation options
</guidelines>
</instructions>
```

**Benefits of XML structuring:**
- Clear separation of different prompt sections
- Easy parsing for automated systems
- Better variable organization and readability
- Reduced ambiguity in complex instructions

### 5. Multi-Step Verification

Build in quality checks:

```text
Task: Write a technical blog post about API security.

Step 1: Create an outline covering these topics:
- Authentication methods
- Authorization patterns
- Data encryption
- Rate limiting
- Input validation

Step 2: Write the full article based on the outline

Step 3: Review your article and verify:
- All topics from the outline are covered
- Examples are accurate and current
- Tone is consistent throughout
- Length is 1200-1500 words
```

## Prompt Engineering Patterns

### 1. The STAR Method

**S**ituation - **T**ask - **A**ction - **R**esult

```text
Situation: You're a product manager at a SaaS company facing declining user engagement
Task: Develop a strategy to increase user retention by 20% in Q4
Action: Analyze user data, identify drop-off points, and create targeted interventions
Result: Present a comprehensive retention strategy with specific metrics and timelines
```

### 2. The PREP Framework

**P**oint - **R**eason - **E**xample - **P**oint

```text
Your task is to recommend a cloud architecture solution.

Point: State your recommendation clearly
Reason: Explain why this is the best choice
Example: Provide a specific use case or comparison
Point: Restate your recommendation with confidence
```

### 3. The Problem-Solution-Benefit Pattern

```text
Problem: [Clearly define the problem you're solving]
Solution: [Your proposed solution approach]
Benefits: [Expected outcomes and advantages]

Please analyze the following scenario using this framework...
```

## Variable Management

### Dynamic Content Integration

**Effective Variable Usage**

```text
Dear {{customer_name}},

Thank you for your {{interaction_type}} regarding {{product_name}}. 
Based on your {{customer_tier}} status, I can offer the following resolution:

{{#if priority_customer}}
- Expedited processing within 24 hours
- Dedicated support manager assignment
- Complimentary premium features for 3 months
{{else}}
- Standard processing within 48 hours
- Priority queue placement
- 10% discount on next purchase
{{/if}}

Best regards,
{{agent_name}}
```

**Variable Validation**

```text
Before processing this prompt, verify that all required variables are present:
- customer_id: {{customer_id}}
- order_date: {{order_date}}
- product_category: {{product_category}}

If any variable is missing or invalid, respond with:
"Error: Missing required variable [variable_name]. Please provide [expected_format]."
```

## Quality Assurance Techniques

### 1. Prompt Testing Framework

**Test Different Scenarios**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Happy Path Testing">
    Test with ideal inputs and conditions to ensure the prompt works as expected
    
    ```text
    Test Input: Complete customer data, clear issue description, standard priority
    Expected Output: Structured response following all guidelines
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Edge Case Testing">
    Test with unusual or extreme inputs
    
    ```text
    Test Cases:
    - Empty or minimal input
    - Extremely long input
    - Special characters and formatting
    - Multiple languages
    - Contradictory information
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Error Handling">
    Ensure graceful handling of problematic inputs
    
    ```text
    If the input contains insufficient information, respond with:
    "I need additional information to provide an accurate response. 
    Please provide: [specific requirements]"
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 2. Consistency Verification

**Response Validation Checklist**

```text
After generating the response, verify:
□ All required sections are present
□ Format matches the specified template
□ Tone is appropriate for the context

```

### 3. Performance Optimization

**Token Efficiency**

```text
Optimize your prompts for token usage:
- Remove redundant phrases
- Use concise language
- Eliminate unnecessary examples
- Focus on essential instructions only

Before: "Please kindly analyze the following data that I am providing to you..."
After: "Analyze this data:"
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Ambiguous Instructions">
    **Problem**: Vague or unclear directions leading to inconsistent outputs
    
    **Poor Example**: "Make it better"
    
    **Solution**: Be specific about what "better" means
    ```text
    Improve this email by:
    - Reducing length by 30%
    - Adding a clear call-to-action
    - Using more professional tone
    - Including specific next steps
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Information Overload">
    **Problem**: Too much context overwhelming the core task
    
    **Solution**: Structure information hierarchically
    ```text
    Primary Task: [Main objective]
    
    Essential Context:
    - [Key point 1]
    - [Key point 2]
    
    Additional Background (reference only):
    - [Supporting detail 1]
    - [Supporting detail 2]
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Inconsistent Formatting">
    **Problem**: Outputs vary in structure and format
    
    **Solution**: Provide explicit formatting templates
    ```text
    Response Format (do not deviate):
    
    TITLE: [Brief title in caps]
    
    OVERVIEW:
    [2-3 sentence summary]
    
    DETAILS:
    • Point 1
    • Point 2
    • Point 3
    
    NEXT STEPS:
    1. [Action item]
    2. [Action item]
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Context Drift">
    **Problem**: AI loses focus on the main objective
    
    **Solution**: Use reminder anchors
    ```text
    Remember: Your primary goal is to [main objective].
    
    [Context and instructions]
    
    Final check: Does your response directly address [main objective]?
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

```text
Analyze the customer type:
{{#if enterprise_customer}}
  Use formal language and include technical details
{{elseif small_business}}
  Use friendly but professional tone, simplify technical concepts
{{else}}
  Use casual, helpful tone with step-by-step explanations
{{/if}}
```

### 3. Feedback Integration

Build improvement mechanisms into your prompts:

```text
After providing your response, evaluate it against these criteria:
1. Does it fully address the user's question?
2. Is the tone appropriate for the context?
3. Are all technical details accurate?
4. Is the response length appropriate?

If any criterion scores below 4/5, revise your response accordingly.
