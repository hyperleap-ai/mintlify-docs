Tools are purpose-built No-Code AI interfaces that help you accomplish specific tasks efficiently. Instead of having open-ended conversations, tools provide structured input forms that:
- Take in specific user inputs
- Process them using Generative AI
- Deliver consistent, reliable outputs

## How Tools Work

Tools follow a structured approach to automate your business tasks:
