## Custom Triggers & Programmatic Control

Beyond the default chatbot button, you can trigger the chatbot from any element on your website using custom buttons, links, or JavaScript.

### Data Attribute Method (Recommended)

The easiest way to control your chatbot is using the `data-aichatbot-invoke` attribute:

```html
<!-- Open chatbot on click -->
<button data-aichatbot-invoke="open">Ask AI Assistant</button>

<!-- Navigation link to open chat -->
<a href="#" data-aichatbot-invoke="toggle">Need Help?</a>

<!-- CTA button -->
<div class="cta-button" data-aichatbot-invoke="open">
  Chat with Sales
</div>
```

**Supported Actions:**
- `open` - Opens the chatbot
- `close` - Closes the chatbot
- `toggle` - Toggles chatbot state
- Empty value defaults to `toggle`

### JavaScript API Method

For advanced use cases, use the global `HyperleapChatbot` API:

```javascript
// Open the chatbot
window.HyperleapChatbot.open();

// Close the chatbot
window.HyperleapChatbot.close();

// Toggle the chatbot
window.HyperleapChatbot.toggle();
```

**Example Use Cases:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Hero Section CTA">
    ```html
    <section class="hero">
      <h1>Get instant answers</h1>
      <button data-aichatbot-invoke="open" class="cta-primary">
        Talk to Our AI Assistant
      </button>
    </section>
    ```
  </Tab>

      document.getElementById('special-offer').addEventListener('click', function() {

        alert('Chat with us to claim your offer!');
        window.HyperleapChatbot.open();
      });
    </script>
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Time-Delayed Popup">
    ```html
