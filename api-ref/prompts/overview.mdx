The Prompts API allows you to run AI prompts with your project. You can trigger prompts with different streaming options based on your application needs.

## Available Endpoints

### [Run Prompt (Non-streaming)](/api-ref/prompts/run-prompt-non-streaming)

Run a specific prompt and get the complete response in a single API call.
<Tip>
    Recommended when creating classifiers to make decisions, since the full response is available for decision making.

```
POST /prompt-runs/run-sync
```

#### Request Format

```json
{
  "promptId": "string", 
  "promptVersionId": "string", 
  "replacements": { 
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": "value2"
  }
}
```

#### Response Format

### [Run Prompt (HTTP/2 Streaming)](/api-ref/prompts/run-prompt-http2-streaming)

Run a specific prompt and stream the response using HTTP/2 protocol. This is useful for real-time applications where you want to display the response as it's being generated.

```
POST /prompt-runs/async
```

{
  "promptId": "string",
  "promptVersionId": "string",

  }
}
```

Streams chunks of data as they become available.

### [Run Prompt (SSE Streaming)](/api-ref/prompts/run-prompt-sse-streaming)

Run a specific prompt and stream the response using Server-Sent Events (SSE) protocol. This is useful for web applications that need to display the response as it's being generated.

```

```

#### Request Format

{
  "promptId": "string",
  "promptVersionId": "string",
  "replacements": {
